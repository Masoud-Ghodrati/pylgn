Installation
============

Pre-configured installation (recommended)
-----------------------------------------
Itâ€™s strongly recommended that you use Anaconda to install pyLGN along with its compiled dependencies.

With `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ or
`Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_::

    conda install -c defaults -c conda-forge -c cinpla pylgn


pyLGN can also be installed by cloning the Github repository::

    $ git clone https://github.com/miladh/pylgn
    $ cd /path/to/pylgn
    $ python setup.py install


Note that dependencies must be installed independently.
