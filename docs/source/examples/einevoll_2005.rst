Response of the DoG model to patch grating
==========================================
In this example script some of the results in `Einevoll et al. (2005) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16212701>`_ is reproduced (figure 4).
In this script the response of the difference of Gaussians (DoG) model to circular drifting-grating patches is calculated. The resulting figure is shown below:
