Response of the DoG model to patch grating
==========================================
In this example script figure 4 in `Einevoll et al. (2005) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16212701>`_ is reproduced.
In the code below the response of the difference of Gaussians (DoG) model to circular drifting-grating patches is calculated:
